# Covid19-Rota-test
Simulate what happens to staffing levels over time under different rates of staff infection.

We have noticed that staff working on frontline services, such as healthcare workers, are becoming infected or self-isolating and this is placing great strain on the service they provide. To enable those in charge of rotas to see what happens under different scenarios we have created this web app. Like any model is it based on some assumptions, however, where possible we have used available data (e.g. see references to the right).
